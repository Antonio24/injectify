## NodeJS injectify client
**NOTE:** It is recommended to use the `../electron` version instead, as this client only supports 30% of the modules.

A basic & simple NodeJS client without the electron framework. Only supports 30% of the non browser-based modules due to the fact that it's pure NodeJS and not running in a browser.
